Filtered Image Gallery using jQuery 1.9.1

This is the jQuery code I wrote to create a filtered image gallery for the homepage of my online portfolio.  The image tiles have data-tags which describe the portfolio piece of work by skill used, and an array of each skill is dynamically created which stores a reference to each image tile having that skill.  The code was adapted from chapter 12 of the book Javascript & jQuery by Jon Duckett, 2014.
